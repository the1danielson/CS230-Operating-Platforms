I was tasked by the Gaming Room to create an app that was similar to the original 1980s game called Win, Lose, or Draw. The app was a game that consisted of teams working together to guess what exactly the word is that related to the picture. I did my best to listen to the clients' request and I believe we did a great job closing the deal. I used the rubric as if it were the clients' list of demands that had to be met. I also think I related the course material with the programming sections of the course which better prepared me for writing code. I wish I took a little more time to write the code right the first time instead of having to use the debug tool so much. I also should have sectioned off the coding in shorter bits. I think the best part about this course is the lessons I learned about fixing code that someone else wrote. I am sure one day I will be proof-reading someone elses program so these experiences are always great.
